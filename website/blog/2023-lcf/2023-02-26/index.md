## **Look Back**: Week 4 Recap

It's hard to believe that our #30daysoflowcode event is coming to an end. Time really flies, doesn't it? But what an amazing month it has been! Thanks to the incredible support from each and every one of you, we've welcomed **100,000+ visitors** to our event! We're thrilled to provide something useful and valuable to your learning journey and we hope that you've fallen in love with the power of low-code development tools. 

We would love to hear your thoughts, and please don't hesitate to reach out to us through [**GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/microsoft/Low-Code/discussions). Your feedback is essential for us to improve and provide even better content and resources in the future. ‚ù§Ô∏è


Throughout the month, we've taken a comprehensive view of Power Platform and its capabilities, from creating custom integrations to building UI and more. And this week, we've focused on a critical topic for Power Platform: developer experience. As you know, it is essential for developers to build and deploy effective solutions, while managing app governance at the same time. 

Let's take a look at what we've covered this week!

* [**ALM For Power Platform**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day20) - App lifecycle management can be a broad but critical topic for every developer, who is building, maintaining, or even retiring an application. By following best practices for app lifecycle management, developers can ensure that their applications are stable, reliable, and performant, while also meeting the needs of end-users and stakeholders.  In this blog, we introduce you to app lifecycel management, and explore how you can manage the entire app lifecycle with Power Platform. 

* [**GitHub Actions for Power Platform**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day21) -  GitHub actions is a powerful tool that allows you to define workflows in code, and Power Platform provides a range of features and connectors that can be used to integrate with GitHub Actions. In this blog, we walk you through basic GitHub Actions concepts and show you how to connect to a Power Platform environment using GitHub Actions to streamline your development process and automate your workflows. 

* [**Power Platform and Governance**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day23) - Governance is a key concern for many organizations when it comes to using low-code platforms like Power Platform. This blog provided guidance on how to manage your app governance at ease using Managed Environments for Power Platform.

* [**Power Apps & Automated Testing**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day24) - When we talk about app lifecycle management, automated testing is an important part of it. This blog introduces automated testing, and provides you with an overview of tools available to test your Power Apps. 

* [**Power Automate, ACS and OpenAI**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day22) - Integrating Power Automate with OpenAI and Azure Communication Services can enable you to build powerful and intelligent applications that can understand natural language and respond accordingly. In this blog, we'll show you a tutorial step-by-step how to build a SMS conversational bot yourself!
